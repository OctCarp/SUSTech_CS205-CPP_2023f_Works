## The First Step to Goldbach's Conjecture

### Description

Goldbach's conjecture is a well-known hypothesis in mathematics, unsolved for centuries. It proposes that every even natural number greater than $2$ can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Now, let's solve it! The first step is determining whether a number is prime.

Write a program that accepts a positive integer $N$ as input, then determines how many prime numbers are there within the inclusive range $[2,N]$, and print them.

**Constraints**: $2≤N≤1×10^5+3$.

### Input

a positive integer $N$.

### Output

all prime numbers within the inclusive range $[2,N]$.

### Sample Input 1

```
20
```

### Sample Output 1

```
prime: 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 
count: 8
```
